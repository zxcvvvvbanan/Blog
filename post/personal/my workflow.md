## Walkthrough

I use Obsidian, Notion, and other tools in my workflow, but to keep things clear, I created a map to organize what gets posted where. 

The terms 'upstream' and 'downstream' are borrowed directly from Linux terminology. ðŸ˜Ž


### **Upstream â€“ Obsidian**

Alpha and omega of note taking.

**Work & Study** -> Github Pages, Confluence

**Personal** <-> Notion 

### **Downstream â€“ GitHub Pages**

**"Area"**, **"Resources"**, and **"Archives"** gets here.

### **Downstream 2 â€“ Notion**

All personal **PARA** used. Not synced with Obsidian.

### **Downstream â€“ Confluence**

In **PARA** terms, finalized, long-term, and verified content gets here, which is **Archive**.
