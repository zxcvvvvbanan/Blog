## Walkthrough

I use Obsidian, Notion, and other tools in my workflow, but to keep things clear, I created a map to organize what gets posted where. 

The 'upstream' and 'downstream' are borrowed directly from Linux terminology.


### **Upstream – Obsidian**

Alpha and omega of note taking.

**Work & Study** -> Github Pages, Confluence

**Personal** <-> Notion 

### **Downstream – GitHub Pages**

**"Area"**, **"Resources"**, and **"Archive"** gets here.

### **Downstream 2 – Notion**

All personal **PARA** used. Not 100% synced with Obsidian.

### **Downstream – Confluence**

Finalized and verified content gets here, which is **Archive**. This would usually be posted in current studio I am working at.
