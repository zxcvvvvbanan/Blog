## Walkthrough

I use Obsidian, Notion, and other tools in my workflow, but to keep things clear, I created a map to organize what gets posted where.

The terms upstream and downstream are inspired by Linux. ðŸ˜Ž


### **Upstream â€“ Obsidian**

This is where I manage the most recent, unorganized, and short-lived notes. Personal notes exists, shared with notion but never gets to Github Pages and Confluence.

**Work & Study** - Github Pages, Confluence

**Personal** - Notion 

In **PARA terms**, these fall under **"Projects"**, as they are active and evolving.

### **Downstream â€“ GitHub Pages**

These tools are for more structured, steady, and long-term content, where I can create tables of contents or maintain organized posts.

In **PARA terms**, these align with **"Areas"**, **"Resources"**, and **"Archives"**, depending on their purpose.

### **Downstream 2 â€“ Notion**

Examples

Proejct: Monthly goals, upcoming events

Area: Financial notes

Resources: Perfume reviews

Archive: Travel to Bangkok 2023

Some notes may be upstream of Obsidian.

**"Projects"** and **"Archives"**


### **Downstream â€“ Confluence**

This is for finalized, long-term, and verified content.

In **PARA terms**, this primarily fits into **"Archive"**, as the content here is well-documented and complete.
