## After Installation

### Other RHEL distros

Might require libGLU or libxcb.


### Fedora

SELinux is probably blocking your sesinetd from starting.
Below will solve the problem.

:::danger
Do not disable your SELinux.

sesinetd can still work in enforced mode.

Set it to at least 'Permissive'
:::

Register your service to systemd if not.

```
sudo cp /usr/lib/sesi/sesinetd.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable sesinetd.service
```

#### Result
```
Synchronizing state of sesinetd.service with SysV service script with /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.
Executing: /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install enable sesinetd
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/sesinetd.service â†’ /etc/systemd/system/sesinetd.service.
```

Now enable your service 
```
sudo systemctl enable sesinetd.service
```

### Wayland ! Move to X11

Houdini will crash on Wayland windowing system. Change to X11

```bash
sudo vim /etc/gdm/custom.conf
```

Uncomment the following line

```
#WaylandEnable=false
```
