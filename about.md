# Why such an effort? 

I was raised and educated to take **nice** note since middle school. Archiving as well. Photos, documents, vidoes and etcetera. Wish I could show you how my NAS, Notion and Obsidian are beautifully structured. (Huge no actually)  :smile:
I tried to take note on my paper notebook but there were limits. Search, edit are nearly impossible, they are fragile to be lost, or damaged.
Rather than keep it in a paper notebook, I've stored it online. Thus, my posts are not official nor solid accurate. Feel free to make use of it, but do not trust my posts like 100%.
It took a while learning all this but happy to be able to share with you all.
Hope you find my site useful.
